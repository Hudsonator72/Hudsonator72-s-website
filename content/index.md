# Hi! My name is Hudsonator72.

I like programming in [lua](https://www.lua.org/). My favorite game is Scrap Mechanic, and I'll even make mods for it now and then. (or at least start to)

I'm currently making a game, although it's not anywhere near being out yet. I'll put it here when it's done though.
